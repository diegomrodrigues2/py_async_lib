# py_async_lib

A custom implementation of the Python `asyncio` library from scratch, featuring a high-performance event loop written in C.

This project is an exploration into the low-level details of asynchronous programming, bridging Python's usability with C's performance. It replaces Python's default event loop with a custom `epoll`-based scheduler to handle I/O, timers, and signals efficiently.

## üìö Architecture Overview

The library is composed of a Python frontend and a C backend. The Python layer provides a user-friendly API that mirrors `asyncio`, while the C extension (`casyncio`) implements the core event loop for maximum performance.

*   **Python User Code**: Your `async/await` code that uses the library.
*   **py_async_lib package**: The main Python package that provides the public API, such as `StreamWriter` and the `install()` function.
*   **asyncio tasks/futures**: Standard `asyncio` objects that represent the result of an asynchronous operation.
*   **casyncio.EventLoop**: The C implementation of the event loop that polls for I/O readiness using `epoll`.
*   **Callbacks**: Python functions scheduled to run when a specific event occurs (e.g., data received on a socket).

## üîÑ Data Flow: A Write Operation

This diagram shows the sequence of events when a user writes data to a stream.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Python Coroutine
    participant SW as StreamWriter
    participant EventLoop as casyncio.EventLoop
    participant OS as Kernel (epoll)

    User->>SW: write(b"data")
    SW->>EventLoop: _c_write(fd, b"data")
    EventLoop->>EventLoop: Append data to OutBuf
    EventLoop->>OS: send(fd, b"data")
    alt Send is incomplete (EAGAIN)
        OS-->>EventLoop: Returns partial write
        EventLoop->>OS: epoll_ctl(ADD, EPOLLOUT)
    else Send is complete
        OS-->>EventLoop: Returns full write count
    end

    User->>SW: await drain()
    SW->>EventLoop: _c_drain_waiter(fd)
    alt Buffer is already empty
        EventLoop-->>SW: Returns completed Future
    else Buffer has pending data
        EventLoop-->>SW: Returns pending Future
    end
    SW-->>User: Awaits Future

    OS->>EventLoop: EPOLLOUT event
    EventLoop->>EventLoop: socket_write_now()
    note right of EventLoop: Drain remaining data from OutBuf
    EventLoop->>EventLoop: Set result on pending Future
```

1.  A coroutine calls `StreamWriter.write()`.
2.  The `StreamWriter` calls the loop's internal `_c_write` method, passing the file descriptor and data.
3.  The C loop attempts a non-blocking `send()`.
4.  If the kernel buffer is full, `send()` returns `EAGAIN`. The loop registers the file descriptor with `epoll` to be notified when it's ready for writing (`EPOLLOUT`).
5.  The `drain()` method creates a `Future` that will be resolved once the buffer is empty.
6.  When `epoll` reports the socket is writable, the loop writes the remaining data and resolves the `Future`.

## üìä Event Loop State

The event loop operates as a simple state machine.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> INIT
    INIT --> RUNNING: run_forever()
    RUNNING --> RUNNING: Processing I/O and callbacks
    RUNNING --> STOPPED: stop() or no more tasks

    state RUNNING {
        direction LR
        [*] --> POLLING
        POLLING --> READY : epoll_wait() returns events
        READY --> POLLING : Execute ready callbacks
    }

    STOPPED --> [*]
```

*   **INIT**: The initial state after `casyncio.EventLoop()` is created.
*   **RUNNING**: The loop enters this state when `run_forever()` is called. It continuously polls `epoll` for events and runs callbacks from its ready queue.
*   **STOPPED**: The `stop()` method sets a flag that causes the loop to exit the `RUNNING` state. The loop also stops if it has no more timers or I/O watchers to handle.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core C Structures

The relationships between the main C structures are key to the library's efficiency.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    PyEventLoopObject {
        int epfd
        PyObject ready_q
        PyObject timers
        FDCallback fdmap
        int sfd
        PyObject signal_handlers
        int running
    }

    FDCallback {
        PyObject reader
        PyObject writer
        OutBuf obuf
    }

    OutBuf {
        char data
        Py_ssize_t len
        Py_ssize_t pos
        PyObject waiters
    }

    PyEventLoopObject ||--o{ FDCallback : "manages for each fd"
    FDCallback ||--o| OutBuf : "has one"
```

*   **`PyEventLoopObject`**: The central object that holds the `epoll` file descriptor (`epfd`), the queue of ready callbacks (`ready_q`), and a map of file descriptors to their corresponding callbacks (`fdmap`).
*   **`FDCallback`**: Stores the `reader` and `writer` callbacks for a single file descriptor.
*   **`OutBuf`**: A write buffer associated with an `FDCallback`. It holds the data to be written and a list of `Future` objects (`waiters`) to be notified upon successful drainage.

### Thread-safe callbacks

The loop exposes `call_soon_threadsafe()` to schedule callbacks from other threads. A self-pipe wakes the event loop so the function can be safely used from worker threads without race conditions.

### run_in_executor and async DNS

`py_async_lib.run_in_executor()` runs blocking functions in a thread pool and integrates with the event loop via `call_soon_threadsafe`. The helper `async_getaddrinfo()` wraps `socket.getaddrinfo` using this mechanism to perform non-blocking DNS lookups.

## üöÄ Benchmark

You can compare the throughput of the project's event loop against Python's built-in `asyncio` loop with the benchmark script:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -m benchmarks.throughput
```

To use the high-performance C loop with `asyncio` in your own project:

```python
import py_async_lib
import asyncio

# Sets the default asyncio policy to use casyncio
py_async_lib.install()

# Now, any call to asyncio.new_event_loop() will return a casyncio.EventLoop
loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
```

### üß™ Running tests

Install the package in editable mode and run the test suite with `pytest`:

```bash
pip install -e .
pytest
```

The tests cover each development milestone, from the initial Python prototype to the C event loop, I/O watchers, and signal handling.

### üìà Development Progress

The development of the C event loop is tracked through a series of issues, each representing a distinct feature:

*   **#1**: A prototype of a micro event loop purely in Python.
*   **#2**: The initial C skeleton, object structure, and build configuration.
*   **#3**: Implementation of `call_soon` and `run_forever`.

*   **#7**: Support for task cancellation and timeouts.
*   **#8**: Management of OS signals and subprocesses.
*   **#9**: Full compatibility with the `asyncio` event loop policy.
*   **#10**: Profiling and final optimizations.
*   **#11**: Implementation of timers with `call_later`.
